# Cargo project structure
* `/` *(project root)* ^1c12f9
	* `src/`
		* *Contains the project's source code* 
	* `target/`
		* `debug/`
			* *Files pertaining to the debug build of the project, including an executable*
		* `release/`
			* *Files pertaining to the release build of the project, including an executable*
	* `cargo.toml`
	  *A toml file specifying the cargo configuration of the project*
	* `cargo.lock`
	    *A file automatically generated by Cargo, not intended to be manually edited*

# Project creation
```bash
cargo project_name
cd project_name
```

# Project building
### Build a project in debug mode
```bash
cargo build
```

Executable will be stored in `./target/debug`

### Build a project for release

```bash
cargo build --release
```
The project takes longer to build but will run more efficiently. Executable will be stored in `./target/release`

# Project running
## Compile and run the project with Cargo
```bash
cargo run
```
If the code has changed since the last build the project will be automatically rebuilt
## Run manually
#### Debug
```bash
./target/debug/project_name
```
#### Release
```bash
./target/release/project_name
```

# Project check
`cargo check` builds the project without producing an executable file.

## Dependencies
Example in the Cargo.toml file of [[Project - Guessing Game|Guessing Game]]
```toml
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8.5"
```
* Specifies that that project needs between 0.8.5 up to 0.9.0 of the rand(om) module.
	* "0.8.5 is actually shorthand for ^0.8.5, which means any version that is at least 0.8.5 but below 0.9.0." - [[THE BOOK]] page 29

* Crates use semantic versioning.

* The automatically generated Cargo.lock file makes sure that, unless otherwise specified, the project will always use the same version of the dependency.

* If you want to update the package, you can do so with `cargo update`. This will update the dependencies to the highest version allowed (In this example, at or above 0.8.5 and below 0.9.0)
